            <h1><strong>Welcome</strong> to My Personal Site</h1>
            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan and my major is CS. I enjoy traveling and photography and
                I have traveled to many countries and regions. I love different cultures, and I like to record different
                human and natural landscapes with my camera. I have put some of my photos and my thoughts on this
                website.</p>

            <p>Beijing is the capital of China and the largest city in China. It is the center of the country's
                political, economic, and cultural development. It is the world's largest metropolis.</p>
            <p>Below are six photos of the city of Beijing. The first three photos are the city of Beijing from the
                perspective of the CBD. The following two photos are the city of Beijing from the perspective of the
                ForbiddenCity. The last photo is the first and biggest Apple Store in China.</p>
            <p>Due to the pandemic, it is now difficult to enter China from foreign countries and travel visas into
                China are not yet open. As an international student in the U.S., it is also very difficult to return to
                China. If we fly from Los Angeles to Shanghai, we need to pay for our own quarantine in Los Angeles for
                7 days, with multiple Covid tests during that time, and up to a month after we return home</p>
