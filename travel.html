        <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan and my major is CS. I enjoy traveling and photography and I have traveled to many countries and regions. I love different cultures, and I like to record different human and natural landscapes with my camera. I have put some of my photos and my thoughts on this website.</p>
