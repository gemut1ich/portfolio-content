        <h1><strong>Welcome</strong> to My Personal Site</h1>
        <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan and my major is CS. I enjoy traveling and photography and I have traveled to many countries and regions. I love different cultures, and I like to record different human and natural landscapes with my camera. I have put some of my photos and my thoughts on this website.</p>

    <p>The University of Michigan (Michigan or UMich) is a public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1817 by an act of the old Michigan Territory, as the Catholepistemiad, or the University of Michigania, 20 years before the territory became a state, the university is Michigan's oldest. The institution was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40 acres (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus, a U.S. historic district. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university has expanded to include some 500 buildings spread out over the city. The university has been governed by an elected board of regents independently of the state since 1850, when the state's second constitution was officially adopted.</p>
