            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan and my major is CS. I enjoy traveling and photography and
                I have traveled to many countries and regions. I love different cultures, and I like to record different
                human and natural landscapes with my camera. I have put some of my photos and my thoughts on this
                website.</p>

            <p>The University of Michigan (Michigan or UMich) is a public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
                Founded in 1817 by an act of the old Michigan Territory, as the Catholepistemiad, or the University of
                Michigania, 20 years before the territory became a state, the university is Michigan's oldest. The
                institution was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40 acres (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus,
                a U.S. historic district. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university has expanded to include
                some 500 buildings spread out over the city. The university has been governed by an elected board of
                regents independently of the state since 1850, when the state's second constitution was officially
                adopted.</p>
            <p>University of Michigan alumni include one U.S. president, eight NASA astronauts, 18 Pulitzer Prize
                winners, 25 Rhodes Scholars, and more than 30 presidents of various universities. As of October 2020, 26
                University of Michigan alumni, professors and researchers have been awarded the Nobel Prize, one Fields
                Medal, and six Turing Prizes (eighth in the world). The vast majority of Michigan governors in history
                have come from the University of Michigan, including Rick Snyder, the 48th governor from 2011 to 2019.
                The University of Michigan is also one of the few cradles and gathering places in the U.S. that produces
                the Chinese elite.

            <p>The University of Michigan was founded in 1817 as the University of Michigania or Catholepistemiad, and
                the University of Michigan system has three campuses, the main campus in Ann Arbor and two smaller
                satellite campuses, the Dearborn and Flint campuses [8]. These three campuses are the three different
                universities within the University of Michigan system, with the term "University of Michigan" usually
                referring specifically to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor campus, and the other two campuses
                having place names as suffixes: "University of Michigan-Dearborn The names of the other two campuses are
                suffixed with a place name: "University of Michigan-Dearborn" and "University of Michigan-Flint" to
                distinguish them.</p>
