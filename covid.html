            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan and my major is CS. I enjoy traveling and photography and
                I have traveled to many countries and regions. I love different cultures, and I like to record different
                human and natural landscapes with my camera. I have put some of my photos and my thoughts on this
                website.</p>

        <p>The coronavirus outbreak has been going on for two years. It was definitely two years in the annals of
            human history. Two years ago, on February 7th, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan died of COVID-19. I wanted to
            honor him by putting his picture on this page</p>
