    <h1><strong>Welcome</strong> to My Personal Site</h1>
    <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan and my major is CS. I enjoy traveling and photography and I have traveled to many countries and regions. I love different cultures, and I like to record different human and natural landscapes with my camera. I have put some of my photos and my thoughts on this website.</p>

        <p>Here is my favorite avatar <strong>Doraemon</strong></p>
        <img src="./images/doraemon.jpeg" alt="Doraemon smiles as he stands in Nobita's room and waves">
        <p>Doraemon was the first Japanese anime I watched and one that I really liked. Since then, I have watched many other Japanese animations and I have become interested in the cultures of different countries as a result.</p>
